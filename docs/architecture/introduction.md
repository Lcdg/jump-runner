# Introduction

This document outlines the complete frontend architecture for **Jump Runner**, a minimalist auto-scroller web game built with TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire codebase.

## Starter Template

**Decision: No starter template** - Project built from scratch with Vite + TypeScript.

**Rationale:**
- Game frameworks (Phaser, PixiJS) would add unnecessary complexity for this simple MVP
- Vite provides minimal scaffolding needed (TS, HMR, build)
- The BMAD goal is learning, not time-to-market optimization
- Vanilla Canvas allows full control over the game loop
